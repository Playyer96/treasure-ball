# treasure-ball

This document is a summary of a Streamline Developer Test project. The document lists what the evaluator should look for in the project, what the developer is proud of, what could have been done better, and the time spent on each task.

Iâ€™m proud of the core system they created which is functional and can be expanded. However, I acknowledge that there could have been improvements in the jump mechanics and adding VFX.

The instructions for the project include finding the 5 keys to open the treasure, using the environment to find them, using jump pads and using the space key to jump and hold to activate a jetpack. The estimated time spent on each task is listed as well, with 


-   Basic Movement & Input - 2.5 Hours
-   Advanced Movement - 3.5 Hours
-   Gameplay - 4 hours
-   Extra - 2.5 hours
